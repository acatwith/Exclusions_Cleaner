# Exclusions_Cleaner
Exclusion Cleaner is a handy tool for Windows Security. It helps you remove specific exclusions when you have too many. But, keep in mind, the creator isn't responsible if something goes wrong or if you cause any damage. You need to be careful and take full responsibility for what happens. It's made just for fun and not for serious stuff. So, enjoy using it, but use it with caution!
